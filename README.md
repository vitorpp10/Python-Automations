# python automations

---

## folder overview

- **`.vscode/`**  
  vs code workspace configuration, including `settings.json` with theme, font, and formatting preferences used while developing these automations.

- **`selenium_/`**  
  small selenium exercises and browser automations (logging into demo sites, clicking elements, sorting products, etc.).  
  these are **focused practice scripts**, not full production-ready projects.

- **`web_scraping/`**  
  examples involving http requests and html parsing using libraries like `requests` and `beautifulsoup`.  
  the goal is to experiment with different scraping techniques and data extraction flows.

each folder explores a different area of automation and helps me build experience step by step.

## how to use this repo

1. choose a folder (`selenium_/` or `web_scraping/`) that matches what you want to explore.  
2. open the script or sub‑readme (when available) to understand the goal of that automation.  
3. create a virtual environment, install the required libraries, and run the scripts locally to see the automations in action.

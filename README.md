# Python Automations

This repository contains a collection of Python automations and experiments organized into folders.  
They are focused on learning and practicing tools like Selenium, HTTP requests, and web scraping.

## Folder overview

- `.vscode/`  
  Contains VS Code workspace configuration, including `settings.json` with theme, font, and formatting preferences used in these projects.

- `selenium_/`  
  Contains small Selenium exercises and automations (for example, logging into demo sites, clicking elements, sorting products, etc.).  
  These are **not full production projects**, but focused scripts to practice browser automation concepts.

- `web_scraping/`  
  Contains examples related to HTTP requests and HTML parsing (e.g., using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`).  
  Again, these are **practice automations**, not complete applications, created to learn and document different scraping techniques.

Each folder represents a different area of Python automation that helps me build experience step by step.

Feel free to explore each directory, run the examples, and follow my progress as I experiment with automation and web scraping.

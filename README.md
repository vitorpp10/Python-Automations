## Folder Overview

- **`.vscode/`**  
  VS Code workspace configuration, including `settings.json` with theme, font, and formatting preferences used while developing these automations.

- **`selenium_/`**  
  Small Selenium exercises and browser automations (logging into demo sites, clicking elements, sorting products, etc.).  
  These are **focused practice scripts**, not full production-ready projects.

- **`web_scraping/`**  
  Examples involving HTTP requests and HTML parsing using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
  The goal is to experiment with different scraping techniques and data extraction flows.

Each folder explores a different area of automation and helps me build experience step by step.

## How to Use This Repo

1. Choose a folder (`selenium_/` or `web_scraping/`) that matches what you want to explore.  
2. Open the script or sub‑README (when available) to understand the goal of that automation.  
3. Create a virtual environment, install the required libraries, and run the scripts locally to see the automations in action.
